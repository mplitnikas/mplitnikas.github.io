Hello, I'm Matt Plitnikas.

This is a space consisting of my collected thoughts on things I'm working on and/or care about (I try to have the two overlap as much as possible).

Things I'm interested in lately:
- linux system administration
- AWS, moving systems to the cloud
- IT security, esp linux related
- AI, agent model of cognition, internal family systems

Oh yeah - I stole the name of this blog wholesale from [Crystal Society](http://crystal.raelifin.com/) by Max Harms. It's a great read if you haven't already.
