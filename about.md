Hello, I'm Matt Plitnikas.

This is a space consisting of my collected thoughts on things I'm working on and/or care about (I try to have the two overlap as much as possible).

Things I'm interested in lately:
- linux system administration
- AWS, moving systems to the cloud
- IT security, esp linux related
- AI, agent model of cognition, internal family systems
