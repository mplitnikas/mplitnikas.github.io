I've finally got a blog!

This is going to be a pretty simple endeavor - no wordpress, minimal css and js. It's intended to be a place for me to record some of my interesting projects and learning, for future reference and just to flex.

Naturally the purpose is going to evolve over time, but for now it's probably going to consist of my volunteer work as a sysadmin at WGOT-LP, and some writeups of security CTFs (eg hackthebox). I'm working towards getting my OSCP by the end of the year, so there's going to be a pretty steady amount of security content here.

Maybe I'll get into some proper blogging, too. I've been interested in the agent model of consciousness lately, a la Minsky's Society of Mind. There are some good parallels in psychology too, like Internal Family Systems. It's interesting to try to bridge human consciousness with artificial consciousness. I'm sure, just like every model of human psychology in the past, that it's too strongly steeped in the technology of its era (think Freud's hydraulic model of the mind alongside the industrial tech of the day). But it's one more viewpoint in the box of possible lenses that we can use to try to understand reality.

Anyway, welcome, thanks for reading.
